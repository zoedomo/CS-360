# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The Weight Tracking App was developed to address the needs of users who want to monitor their daily weight, set, and track weight loss or gain goals, and receive notifications upon achieving those goals. Users needed an easy-to-use tool to input and visualize their daily weight data and manage their health goals effectively.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
•	Login Screen: To provide secure access to user-specific data.

•	Registration Screen: To create an account and login.

•	Home Screen: Displaying weight data, goal progress, and options to add new weight entries.

•	SSM Notification System: To notify users when they achieve their goals.

The design focused on simplicity, making it easy for users to input and view data. The navigation flow was designed to be straightforward. This allowed users to easily visualize their progress toward their goals.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
- Object-Oriented: Utilized object-oriented programming principles for modularity.

- MVC Architecture: Separated concerns for maintainability.

- Database Handling: Implemented a SQLite database for data storage.

These practices promote code maintainability, scalability, and overall code quality, which are essential for successful app projects, and can serve as a foundation for future app development.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I conducted unit tests, UI tests, and manual testing. Which ensured the app's functionality and identified and fixed bugs. This detected any issues in data retrieval and user input validation.

# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Innovating in the design and implementation of the notification system was essential to create a feature that added significant value to the app. It enhanced the user experience by providing feedback and motivation, ultimately helping users achieve their weight goals more effectively.

# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The mobile app's database handling component demonstrated my knowledge and skills, as it involved complex operations for storing and retrieving user data, which is essential for the app's functionality and user experience.
